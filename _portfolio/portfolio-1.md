* Build autonomy for a 5-DOF robotic arm, utilizing computer vision techniques, kinematics, and path planning to enable the robot to manipulate various objects. 
* Utilized AprilTag for camera calibration, and the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) method was employed for computing forward kinematics, along with geometric methods for inverse kinematics. 
* A combination of OpenCV and a depth camera was used to detect and locate different color blocks. By recognizing different color blocks in the RGB camera and determining their position in the world coordinate system, successful grasping was achieved.
