* Use an autonomous maze-solving robot to perceive its surroundings, map the environment, and implement A* algorithm for self-navigation. 
* Assembled and controlled an MBot, including the design of a gripping mechanism. 
* Implemented PID feedback control for motor speed and developed a velocity-command-based robot motion controller. 
* Utilized Lidar for 2D mapping, built a SLAM system for environment mapping and localization. 
* Implemented A* algorithm for map navigation.
