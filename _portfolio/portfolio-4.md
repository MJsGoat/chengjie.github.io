* Established mathematical model of Brushless DC motor, simulated in Matlab/Simulink, and analyze the output of the motor model. 
* Examined the control methods, including LQR method, sliding mode control method, and FOC method. 
* Established nonlinear observer model to observe the parameters of BLDC motor. 
* Realized sensorless field-oriented control of Brushless DC motor.
